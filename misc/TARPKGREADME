Please read this README file first before attenmtping to install a pre-built tar package:

IMPORTANT!
You need to set up the base system correctly before installing the package. 
This means setting up the hostname of the system you want to install this package on
(this can be anything.tznet except main or local)

Second you will need to set up the system to have the correct IP address:
for a base station that address is always 192.168.93.2
for a remote site that address is always 192.168.23.2

Third make sure you have an administrative account called sys that can sudo to root

Once this is done extract the tar package you want to install and cd to the directory that was extracted.
run ./installpkg.sh install to install the package.

to uninstall the package just run ./installpkg.sh uninstall from inside the same directory. Make sure you keep this extracted directory around 
if you want to be able to uninstall the package later.
