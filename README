This is a collection of open source software, config files, content and 
packaging intended for use with the Solar Outpost project in tanzania.

How to build:
Right now the best way to do a build is on debian or ubuntu
with dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc 

###For Debian/Ubuntu ###
install build-essential, devscripts, debhelper
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

You will get several packages:
 * outpostserver-basestation -- everything that needs to be on the serverat the base station. 

 * outpostserver-remote -- everything that needs to be on the server at a remote site.

 * outpostserver-client -- anything that needs to be modified on the client goes here.

 * outpostserver-content -- Initial content package with a collection of wiki pages and various documentation/tools for the solar system. 

###For Everything else ###
on other distros you will need to install samba, php5, lighttpd etc and
then use make/make install and make sure you have WWWROOT, WWW_USER, WWW_GROUP set correctly. by default make will build things for a base station make TYPE=remote for a remote site.

Make insall will actually install everything onto the host system
be aware that it will overwrite certain config files mainly smb.conf, hosts, resolv.conf, php.ini for cgi etc. 

make contentinstall will install various wiki and static content under /var/www

to make things a bit more friendly you can do a make tarpkg (with the correct type and other variables set) to make a tar file that you can extract and run an included script which should allow you to easily install/uninstall it on another machine. (The tarpkg method is probably not what you want to do but it is there none the less incase you might find it useful) 

All of this is untested outside of Debian/Ubuntu at the moment. The only supported way to install is through debian packages.
