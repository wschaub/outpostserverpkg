#NEW instructions
 * clone the git tree or unpack the source tarball.
 * run ./build.sh to interactively go through the build/install process or
 use one of the following options to build.sh:
 firstinstall -- First time install this installs everything including the initial content
 install -- Installs everything except the initial content.
 docinstall -- installs only the initial content.
 tarpkg -- creates a gzipped tar archive containing everything + a standalone install script.
 debpkg -- runs dpkg-buildpackage to build a set of debain packages. 


#OLD instructions
To set up the .tznet smarttop servers perform the following steps:
 * install maverick (either headless or full, it doesn't really matter)
 * set up /etc/network/interfaces to give eth0 a static address (192.168.93.2 gw 192.168.93.1 for main and 192.168.23.2 gw 192.168.23.1 for a remote site)
 * type aptitude update
 * type aptitude install dnsmasq lighttpd php5-cgi php5-sqlite samba vim
 * type lighty-enable-mod fastcgi fastcgi-php
 * type service lighttpd force-reload
 * type chown www-data:www-data /var/www

Now we are ready to extract the overlay tarball:
  * if the machine you are installing is the base station site use sys1-overlay.tgz if it is the solar outpost use sys2-overlay.tgz
  * if this is the base station site run "gunzip -c sys1-overlay.tgz | ( cd /; tar xvpf -)" otherwise use sys2-overlay.tgz instead.

Fix the clients:
included in this tarball is an smb.conf file copy it to /etc/samba on all the Smart top and Smart Book computers that will be 
using the fileserver if you dont they will be unable to browse the windows shares. (This is only needed on Ubuntu Maverick, This seems to be fixed already in natty)
