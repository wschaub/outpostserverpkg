   * imported everything into git and added a proper build system that is capable
     of doing first time installs and updates.

   * re-oragnized everything so that all files only live in one place for better maintainability.

   * Improved the sunsaver and powerbutton services to be proper daemons with
     command line options and manpages.

   * Content is now seperate from the rest of the system and is optionally installed.

   * This version can now (optionally) be built as a set of debian packages.


0.4 --
   * updated sunsaver log utility to the most recent version which includes
     a cosmetic change and a tool to look for power button presses and
     shut the system down cleanly.
   
   * added initial wiki content with instructions and a wiki tutorial to the 
     sys1 and sys2 overlays.

   * updated smb.conf and dnsmasq on sys1 overlay to deal with some network
     browsing issues with samba.

   * added /etc/rc2.d/S99nmbd to force nmbd to start on both sys1 and sys2
     for some reason upstart can sometimes fail to start nmbd. If this happens
     there is no possibility to browse the workgroup. I really am starting
     to hate upstart and ubuntu in general.

   * updated /etc/hosts to have www.main.tznet and www.local.tznet because
     some browsers are retarded and will try to put www in front of any hostname
     you give them.

   * added /etc/rc2.d/S99powerbutton to start the powerbutton utility that
     monitors /dev/input/event0 for power button presses and shuts the 
     system down.

   
0.3 --
  * added /opt/sunsaver/bin/sunsaver (a program that logs the sunsaver modbus 
    info to a log file) to the sys2 overlay.

  * added /etc/rc2.d/S99sunsaver to start the item listed above to the sys2
    overlay.

  * added /etc/logrotate.d/sunsaver to make sure /var/log/sunsaver.csv
    will never fill up the internal SSD.

  * added a /status page that shows DHCP leases and solar system status 
    (only if a logfile is found)
  
  * added a link to /status to index.html on both overlays. 

  * made sure the /etc/ssh directory is included in the overlays
 
  * added vim to the list of packages to install in the README file.
  
0.2 -- 
  * Fixed index.html and dokuwiki accounts and start pages between sys1 and sys2 overlays.

  * Include /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini with a max upload limit of 300MB
  
  * Document the samba config problem in maverick that prevents browsing the 
  workgroup in gnome in the README file and include an smb.conf to put on the
  clients to fix this problem.
